Matchng type. Match the following characteristics or description to the corresponding protocol.{
=Simple and straightforward method->
=After station finds line idle, it sends its frames immediately(with a probability 1)
=Highest chance of collision.

Random delays reduces probability of collisions because two stations with data to be transmitted will wait for different amount of times.
Bandwidth is wasted if waiting time (backoff) is large because medium will remain idle following end of transmission even if one or more stations have frames to send 

Reduces chance of collision
If station finds line idle,it follows these steps
A) with probability p,the station sends its frame
B)with probability q=1-p,the station waits for the beginning of next time slot and checks line again
