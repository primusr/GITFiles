Matchng type. Match the following characteristics or description to the corresponding protocol.
{
=Simple and straightforward method -> 1 Persistent CSMA
=After station finds line idle, it sends its frames immediately with a probability 1 -> 1 Persistent CSMA
=Highest chance of collision. -> 1 Persistent CSMA
=Random delays reduces probability of collisions because two stations with data to be transmitted will wait for different amount of times. -> p Persistent CSMA
=Bandwidth is wasted if waiting time (backoff) is large because medium will remain idle following end of transmission even if one or more stations have frames to send. -> p Persistent CSMA 
=Reduces chance of collision -> Non-persistence CSMA
=If station finds line idle,it follows these steps with probability p,the station sends its frame the station waits for the beginning of next time slot and checks line again. -> Non persistent CSMA
