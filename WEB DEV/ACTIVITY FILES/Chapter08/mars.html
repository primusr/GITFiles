<h1>A Princess Of Mars</h1>
<h3>by Edgar Rice Burroughs</h3>
<h3>Chapter 1 - On the Arizona Hills</h3>

<p>I am a very old man; how old I do not know.  Possibly I am a hundred, possibly more; but I cannot tell because I have never aged as other men, nor do I remember any childhood. So far as I can recollect I have always been a man, a man of about thirty.  I appear today as I did forty years and more ago, and yet I feel that I cannot go on living forever; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection.  I do not know why I should fear death, I who have died twice and am still alive; but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died, and it is because of this terror of death, I believe, that I am so convinced of my mortality. And because of this conviction I have determined to write
down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of
my death.  I cannot explain the phenomena; I can only set
down here in the words of an ordinary soldier of fortune a
chronicle of the strange events that befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an Arizona cave.</p>

<p>
I have never told this story, nor shall mortal man see this
manuscript until after I have passed over for eternity.  I know that the average human mind will not believe what it cannot grasp, and so I do not purpose being pilloried by the public, the pulpit, and the press, and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate.  Possibly the suggestions which I gained upon Mars, and the knowledge which I can set down in this chronicle, will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet; mysteries to you, but no longer mysteries to me.
